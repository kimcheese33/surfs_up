# Surfs Up Statistical Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to utilize SQLite and SQLAlchemy to analyze temperature data and analyze the statistical summaries for the month of June and December.

## Results

Looking at the summary statistics for both June and December we can see some key differences:

-- For June there were 1700 data points, while in December there were only 1517 data points.

-- Across the board, June had higher temperatures. This makes sense since June is a summer month.

-- The standard deviation for June was 3.26 while for December it was 3.75. This indicates that the June data is little bit more reliable.
